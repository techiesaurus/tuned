= The location of TuneD profiles

[role="_abstract"]
*TuneD* stores profiles in the following directories:

[filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/profiles/`::
Distribution-specific profiles are stored in the [filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/profiles/` directory. Each profile has its own directory. The profile consists of the main configuration file called `tuned.conf`, and optionally other files, for example helper scripts.

[filename]`/etc/tuned/profiles/`::
If you need to customize a profile, copy the profile directory into the [filename]`/etc/tuned/profiles/` directory, which is used for custom profiles, and then adjust it. If there is a system profile and a custom profile of the same name, the custom profile located in [filename]`/etc/tuned/profiles` is used.

.User-defined profile directories
====
If you want to make TuneD load profiles from a directory other than [filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/profiles/` and [filename]`/etc/tuned/profiles/`, you can list it in [filename]`/etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf` as follows:
----
profile_dirs=/usr/lib/tuned/profiles,/etc/tuned/profiles,/my/custom/profiles
----
In this example, profiles are loaded also from [filename]`/my/custom/profiles/`. If two directories contain profiles with the same names, the one that is listed later takes precedence.
