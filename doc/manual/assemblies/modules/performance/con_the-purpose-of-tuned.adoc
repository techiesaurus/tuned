= The purpose of Aspect-TuneD

[role="_abstract"]
*Aspect-TuneD* is a service that monitors your system and optimizes the performance under certain workloads. The core of *Aspect-TuneD* are _profiles_, which tune your system for different use cases.

*Aspect-TuneD* is distributed with a number of predefined profiles for use cases such as:

* High throughput
* Low latency
* Saving power

It is possible to modify the rules defined for each profile and customize how to tune a particular device. When you switch to another profile or deactivate *Aspect-TuneD*, all changes made to the system settings by the previous profile revert back to their original state.

You can also configure *Aspect-TuneD* to react to changes in device usage and adjusts settings to improve performance of active devices and reduce power consumption of inactive devices.

// The Aspect-TuneD tuning service can adapt the operating system to perform better under certain workloads by setting a tuning profile.
