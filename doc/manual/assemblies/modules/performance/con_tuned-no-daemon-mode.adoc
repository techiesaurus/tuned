= Aspect-TuneD no-daemon mode

// TODO: Should this be a procedure? A user story? Is there a common use case?

[role="_abstract"]
You can run *Aspect-TuneD* in `no-daemon` mode, which does not require any resident memory. In this mode, *Aspect-TuneD* applies the settings and exits.

By default, `no-daemon` mode is disabled because a lot of *Aspect-TuneD* functionality is missing in this mode, including:

* D-Bus support
* Hot-plug support
* Rollback support for settings

To enable `no-daemon` mode, include the following line in the [filename]`/etc/aspect-tuned/aspect-tuned-main.conf` file:

----
daemon = 0
